      <span>USAGE AND INVESTMENT RISK</span>
      <p>The protocol is not liable for losses, damages, or claims resulting from user errors, software issues, technical failures, security problems, or activities of third parties. It is crucial to note that TENEX does not regulate, control, or promise the monetary value of the TENEX token. The value of the TENEX token can fluctuate based on various factors, and holding or using the token carries no guarantees of returns or specific benefits. Users should understand that TENEX does not create an investment contract or any obligation for users based on expected returns or benefits. Investing in cryptocurrencies involves risks, and the information on the protocol does not assure protection against financial loss. Users must understand and assess these risks and make informed decisions when using the protocol.</p>

      <span>COMPLIANCE WITH TAX OBLIGATIONS</span>
      <p>Users are solely responsible for determining their tax obligations related to cryptocurrency holdings. The protocol and its contributors are not responsible for determining users' tax liabilities arising from transactions. Always ensure compliance with local laws and regulations in your jurisdiction before making any purchases and conduct your own research on tax regulations. It is your responsibility to determine whether taxes apply to any transactions you initiate or receive and, if so, to report and/or remit the correct tax to the appropriate tax authority.</p>

We implement and maintain reasonable administrative, physical, and technical security measures, and other applicable laws, to protect unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction of the data we collect.
